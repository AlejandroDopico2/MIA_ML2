    "# Federated Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning is a machine learning paradigm that enables decentralized training of a shared model by multiple clients while preserving data privacy. The main idea behind this new paradigm is that each client trains a local model on its own data and then sends only the model updates to a central server, rather than sending the raw data. This allows the model to be trained on a large amount of data without compromising data privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning was first proposed by Google in 2016 (McMahan et al., 2016) and has since been applied in various fields, such as healthcare (Hard et al., 2018), finance (Yoon et al., 2018), and natural language processing (Li et al., 2020).  For example, federated learning could be used to train a model that can make personalized recommendations for each user without requiring the raw data from each user to be shared with a central server. This is the mechanism by which the model is trained on data, while adhering to data privacy requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning is a machine learning approach that offers numerous advantages over traditional centralized methods. Firstly, by leveraging distributed data stores, federated learning can scale to handle significantly larger datasets. Secondly, it prioritizes data privacy by avoiding the transmission of raw data to a central server. Finally, federated learning enables collaboration among multiple clients, allowing them to jointly train a shared model without compromising the security of their individual data. Overall, these benefits make federated learning a promising approach for machine learning in fields where data privacy is of the utmost importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning is a process in which a central server distributes a machine learning model to multiple devices. Each device trains the model on its local data and sends the updated model back to the central server. The central server then aggregates the updates from each device to improve the global model. This process is repeated until the model converges and can generate accurate predictions on new data. The key concepts within this process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Client: refers to a device or edge node that holds a local dataset and actively participates in the training of the federated model.\n",
    "* Server: represents the central entity that coordinates the training of the federated model and receives model updates from the clients to aggregate into a new version of the global model.\n",
    "* Federated dataset: the collection of decentralized datasets from different clients that are used to train the federated model through collaborative learning.\n",
    "* Federated model: a machine learning model that is trained on the federated dataset using federated learning to make accurate predictions on new data while preserving the privacy of each client's data.\n",
    "* Federated optimization: refers to the process of training the federated model using the decentralized data and model updates from the clients, which enables the model to generalize better on unseen data while preserving the privacy of the clients.\n",
    "* Aggregation: the process of combining the model updates received from the clients into a new version of the global model. This can be done using various methods such as weighted averaging or other approaches.\n",
    "* Rounds: refer to the number of times a federated model is distributed among clients after performing an aggregation to train the model further. The process is repeated until the model converges and achieves a satisfactory level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Federated learning is a relatively new approach, and as such, there are few libraries available that have adapted to it. The main actors in this space are TensorFlow Federated, PySyft, OpenMined, and Flower. Of these, TensorFlow Federated is a notable mention, although it is currently only a theoretical approach, as it does not allow for the deployment of the solution and only simulates the federated space. In contrast, Flower allows for the distribution of federated learning, although the necessary modifications can be somewhat challenging. For this tutorial, we have chosen Flower due to its more user-friendly approach and potential for future use.\n",

It's important to note that Flower is not a learning framework in itself, and as such, it wraps other machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or Scikit-learn in the communication layer to enable federated learning.\n",

    "To conclude this lesson, let's take a closer look at the key point of these strategies, which is the aggregation algorithm. These algorithms are responsible for combining the updates from the clients to generate the global model, and they are defined in the strategies as we have seen. Generally speaking, there are several types of aggregation that can be used in federated learning (Reddi et. al, 2020).  \n",

    "Here are the different types of aggregation that can be used in federated learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated averaging (`flwr.server.strategy.FedAvg`): In this approach, each device computes an update to the model parameters based on its local data, and these updates are then averaged together to create the global model. This approach is simple and effective, but it can be sensitive to the size of the updates and the quality of the data on each device.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated weighted averaging: This approach is similar to federated averaging, but each device's update is given a different weight based on the size of its data set or the quality of its data. This can help to give more influence to devices with larger or higher-quality data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated averaging with momentum (`flwr.server.strategy.FedAvgM`): This approach is similar to federated averaging, but it incorporates a momentum term in order to smooth out the updates and help the model converge more quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated stochastic gradient descent(`flwr.server.strategy.FedAdagrad`): In this approach, each device computes an update to the model parameters based on a small batch of its local data, rather than the entire data set. This can help to reduce the communication overhead and improve the convergence rate of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Federated ADAM (`flwr.server.strategy.FedAdam`): This approach is a variant of federated stochastic gradient descent that uses the ADAM optimization algorithm to adaptively adjust the learning rate based on the gradient and second moment estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the previously mentioned aggregation methods, except for Federated Weighted Averaging, are implemented in the `flwr` framework and can be used with the different strategies. Additionally, there are other less common aggregation methods that can be employed. The choice of aggregation method will ultimately depend on the specific characteristics of the data and the requirements of the task at hand.\n"
